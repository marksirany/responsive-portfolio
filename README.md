For this homework we were to update our website from homework one using bootstrap to make it a repsonsive website.

What I Was Able to Do:

I was able to change the style of the font and also the sizing of divs. I was able, for the most part, to use bootstrap elements pretty successfully. I was also able to add a footer with vertical columns to the bottoms of each page and also to get all the links to work so that they took you to the right page onclick.

Issues I had: 

I had issues with the navbar and could not figure out how to get the three menus to be on the right, but I did use bootstrap. I could not figure out how to make the footer sticky.
